        <p>
          Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five
          players each, op posing one another on a rectangular court, compete
          with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4
          inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defende r's hoop (a basket 18
          inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a
          backboard at ea ch end of the court, while preventing the opposing
          team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two
          points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth
          three. After a f oul, timed play stops and the player fouled or
          designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three
          one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the
          game wins, but if regulat ion play expires with the score tied, an ad
          ditional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
