            <h2>Football</h2>
            <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.</p>
               Common rules among the sports include:
             <ul>
                <li>Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.</li>
                <li>A clearly defined area in which to play the game.</li>
                <li>Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.</li>
                <li>Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts.</li>
                <li>The goal or line being defended by the opposing team.</li>
                <li>Players using only their body to move the ball.</li>
             </ul>
