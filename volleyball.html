        <h2>Volleyball</h2>
        <p>
          Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are
          separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a
          ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It has been a
          part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo
          1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta
          1996. The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games
          is sitting volleyball. The first country outside the United States to
          adopt volleyball was Canada in 1900. An international federation, the
          Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), was founded in 1947,
          and the first World Championships were held in 1949 for men and 1952
          for women. The sport is now popular in Brazil, in Europe (where
          especially Italy, the Netherlands, and countries from Eastern Europe
          have been major forces since the late 1980s), in Russia, and in other
          countries including China and the rest of Asia, as well as in the
          United States. A nudist/naturist volleyball game at the Sunny Trails
          Club during the 1958 Canadian Sunbathing Association (CSA) convention
          in British Columbia, Canada Beach volleyball, a variation of the game
          played on sand and with only two players per team, became a
          FIVB-endorsed variation in 1987 and was added to the Olympic program
          at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Volleyball is also a sport at the
          Paralympics managed by the World Organization Volleyball for Disabled.
          Nudists were early adopters of the game with regular organized play in
          clubs as early as the late 1920s. By the 1960s, a volleyball court had
          become standard in almost all nudist/naturist clubs.The International
          Volleyball Federation (FIVB) is an international confederation of
          volleyball, beach volleyball and lawn volleyball sports that was
          established in 1947 (AD) in Paris, France, and currently has 220
          member countries. The headquarters of the International Volleyball
          Federation is located in Lausanne, Switzerland
